The tldr; is that, yes, you can develop on Chromebook and depending on what you consider to be &quot;developing on a Chromebook&quot; the experience can either be on-par with other computers or a tad... funky.</p>
<p>To start, I want to clearly define what it means to &quot;develop on a Chromebook&quot; because it&#39;s important to the conversation. There are 4 routes that you can go. I won&#39;t spend a lot of time on the first 3 as they are obvious and less interesting to discuss, but the 4th is where the meat of this post belongs. Without further ado the four methods are:</p>
<h2><a name="croutonhttpsgithub-comdnschneidcrouton" class="anchor" href="#croutonhttpsgithub-comdnschneidcrouton"><span class="header-link"></span></a><strong><a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">Crouton</a></strong></h2>
<p>This gives you a chroot environment with which you can install Ubuntu and do whatever you want. Some people really like doing this. Which is fine, but at this point you&#39;re not really using ChromeOS to develop on, even if you do dual-boot.</p>
<h2><a name="ssh" class="anchor" href="#ssh"><span class="header-link"></span></a><strong>SSH</strong></h2>
<p>Using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">Secure Shell</a>, a Native Client enabled SSH client, you can login into a remote computer and work using usual command-line tools like Tmux and Vim. This is currently the primary way I code on a Chromebook. While it works rather well, it&#39;s not always ideal as, for example, it&#39;s difficult to develop Chrome packaged apps this way. Getting the <code>crx</code> file from your server to your Chromebook is tricky.</p>
<p>The best way to work this way is to use <a href="http://www.lbreda.com/grive/start">Grive</a>, a Google Drive sync client for Linux. Once you&#39;ve created the <code>crx</code> simply copy it to a folder in Drive. From there you can open the file in Chrome&#39;s File Manager and it will prompt to be installed. Still, this is a slow process, as the file has to be uploaded to Drive, then downloaded back down from Drive on the Chromebook and installed.</p>
<p>But for certain types of programmers, particularly system programmers, who are always programming from an ssh session anyways, this works out as well as any other computer. Perhaps even better, Secure Shell is a very slick &quot;terminal emulator&quot; (for the lack of a better term).</p>
<h2><a name="web-ide" class="anchor" href="#web-ide"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Web IDE</h2>
<p>This is the first <em>real</em> way to program on a Chromebook. For a lot of people this works nicely. There are a lot of choices out there, two that stand out are <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a> and <a href="https://www.nitrous.io">Nitrous.io</a>. I have used Cloud9 a bit and it works rather nicely. For people who are used to using desktop IDE&#39;s like Eclipse then this might work well for you. My only complaint is that when you use a SaaS client you kind of have to use it for everything. That&#39;s just not my style though. I prefer a seperate application for each task, that way I can swap out the pieces I don&#39;t like. With a Web IDE if you don&#39;t like any one piece your own recourse is to switch to an entirely different IDE.</p>
<h2><a name="working-locally" class="anchor" href="#working-locally"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Working locally</h2>
<p>Which brings me to the last way to work, the most interesting way to work, and the most frustrating way to work on a Chromebook. Despite the complaints that are to follow I want to make it clear that the future looks bright for this category. There are many applications and APIs under development (as I&#39;ll discuss) that are going to dramatically improve the experience of developing locally on a Chromebook.</p>
<p>Since packaged apps are still in their young days there aren&#39;t a million options for text editors, but there are already a few. The best of which is probably Google&#39;s own <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/text/mmfbcljfglbokpmkimbfghdkjmjhdgbg?hl=en">Text</a> (of which I&#39;m an inactive contributor). It&#39;s not great, but it&#39;s just fine for the earlier stages of things.</p>
<p>However, you run into trouble when you start thinking about workflow. This is the area that Chrome needs to round out with better APIs. Let&#39;s say you are starting a new project on your Chromebook, where do you store it? Well, on many Chromebooks there is little hard drive space so having a lot of development projects on it might be a bad idea (my Chromebook considers it&#39;s entire hard drive to be a &quot;Downloads&quot; folder, indicating that it is intended for temporary storage only). The alternative is to use Google Drive, which is probably the best option for now. You can even mark files as available offline in Drive and not have to worry about losing an internet connection.</p>
<p>This is still not quite ideal, though. Drive is limited, you have to manage how much stuff you keep there. And perhaps your work uses Dropbox. There is no way to use Dropbox (besides the web app) on a Chromebook. This is why I&#39;ve long wanted an API for filesystems, so that WebDAV or Dropbox or whatever can live right beside Google Drive in the File Manager and file picker menus. Luckily there has been some movement on this issue lately with some Googlers <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VkaRYDP3RMESygl6Po0ajimXqijejZNF2p9rCszYEew/edit">discussing the idea</a>. It&#39;s not evidence that it will be coming soon, it&#39;s just a positive sign that they are thinking about the same things.</p>
<p>Even if you are able to develop locally how do you share that code? How do you use source control? This is one area where things look positive. The developer Tim Caswell has been working on <a href="https://github.com/creationix/js-git">js-git</a>, a reimplementation of <code>git</code> in JavaScript (including the use of Chrome socket APIs) for the past few months. Although still in early stages I can see this project becoming very usable in the near term.</p>
<p>Suddenly the workflow starts to look a bit nicer. Imagine have a Git web-app (powered by <code>js-git</code>) that manages a git repo, then doing developing with Text or another editor, then going back to the git app to commit and push. What would be even better is if a git repo could become a &quot;filesystem&quot; that sits in the filepicker. That way it could be always connected (perhaps a save operation prompted a commit) and therefore always up to date in the cloud.</p>
<p>This just leaves out one area of a developer&#39;s workflow; testing. If you&#39;re developing for the browser you&#39;re in luck ;) There&#39;s a nice one sitting in front of your face. For everyone else... perhaps a Chromebook isn&#39;t what you need. Still, it might be possible in the future to compile a small linux environment like busy box down to a JavaScript blob and even install things like Python on it. I&#39;m getting a bit a head of myself, and those things would (likely) never be very fast, but it&#39;s something we can see happening. Certainly languages that compile to JavaScript are already flourishing, and most have the ability to compile within a browser, so as long as you are using browser APIs you&#39;re set.</p>

However what you can do is use an old computer to sync between Google Drive and your other cloud drives, providing (close to) the same effect. I set up a Raspberry Pi, which was previously setting in my basement looking pretty and acting as a Cloud Print server but nothing else, as a WebDAV server which has worked out rather nicely. The one downside is that Chromebooks only support Google Drive as a cloud drive service.</p>
<p>It&#39;s rather nice how well Drive is integrated into ChromeOS. And eventually, hopefully, they&#39;ll open up an API that allows other cloud services to have similar integration. That would really change the way you think about ChromeOS, pulling it a few steps closer to &quot;real computer&quot; territory.</p>
<p>Alas that&#39;s not the case today, but what you can do is take an old computer, or raspberry pi, and have it act as a synchronization server between your services. This will work with Dropbox, SkyDrive, Ubuntu One, or any provider that supports WebDAV.</p>
<h1><a name="syncing-google-drive-to-your-server" class="anchor" href="#syncing-google-drive-to-your-server"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Syncing Google Drive to your server</h1>
<p>I won&#39;t get into how to set up your other cloud services to sync, most either have first or third party clients that are easy enough to set up. As is the case with Google Drive. First there is the proprietary app <a href="https://www.insynchq.com/">Insync</a> that works pretty well and has added features such as multiple account support. If your needs are simpler then <a href="http://www.lbreda.com/grive/start">Grive</a> should do the trick, and it is what I use.</p>
<p>On a Raspberry Pi setting everything up was somewhat complicated as it requires several dev packages (strangely including QT4). <a href="http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2013/03/raspberry-pi-google-drive-grive.html">This guide</a> does a good job of walking you through the process, although I had to apply the fix shown in <a href="https://github.com/Grive/grive/issues/168">this issue</a> to get it to finally compile.</p>
<p>Once install <code>grive</code> is still a little strange to use. It requires that its binary be stored in the root of Google Drive, and it must be run from within that directory. So just remember that when you want to sync Drive to do <code>cd ~/googledrive &amp;&amp; ./grive</code> or just create a script that does that for you.</p>
<p>Since <code>grive</code> only syncs when you run it you&#39;ll want to set up a cron job to do it periodically. Type <code>crontab -e</code> and do something like this:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">*</span><span class="err">/5 * * * * ~/update-grive.sh &gt;&gt; ~/log/grive.log</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>This tells cron to run the script every 5 minutes. Doing it a little more often probably isn&#39;t a problem, I&#39;m just being conservative for now.</p>
<h1><a name="syncing-with-other-cloud-provider" class="anchor" href="#syncing-with-other-cloud-provider"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Syncing with other cloud provider</h1>
<p>First a word of warning; anything you choose to sync with Drive will exist in Drive; meaning it will count against your storage. For this reason I only sync text files. But it&#39;s your storage, do with it what you want.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve set up sync with your other cloud provider you should have a folder on your server with it&#39;s contents. It would be nice if a simple symlink did the trick, but alas grive won&#39;t sync down changes from Drive that propogate to the symlink&#39;s destination.</p>
<p>Instead I&#39;d recommend the handly utility <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">Unison</a> for two-way sync. So any changes you make to one drive will be merged over into the other. I&#39;m not sure how it handles conflicts, but more than likely you won&#39;t be editing the same file in two different services at the same time anyways.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve installed Unison you&#39;ll want to go through the process of running it through the ui the first time:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">unison</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="err">/webdav/reviews ~/googledrive/webdav_stuff</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that there is no source and destination here so it doesn&#39;t matter which you list first. After the first synchronization you&#39;ll want to run unison silently so that it doesn&#39;t prompt you for instructions. You can achieve this with the <code>-batch</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">unison</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">batch</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="err">/webdav/reviews ~/googledrive/webdav_stuff</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>Add this to cron the same way you did previously with grive:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">*</span><span class="err">/5 * * * * ~/sync-folders.sh &gt;&gt; ~/log/unison.log</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>And that&#39;s it! From now on you can work on your files no matter what computer you&#39;re on. When I&#39;m on a traditional PC I edit files on my WebDAV drive, and when on a Chromebook I use Google Drive (which is how I&#39;m writing this article now).</p>
<h2><a name="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The recent updates to Chromebooks and the new packaged apps 2.0 is opening a lot of the possibilities to the platform. Additionally it is showing some of the warts, such as the inability to work on files from <em>other</em> sources. Although I think these holes will eventually be filled, in the mean time we need to do workarounds such as this in order to work the way we want to work. I plan on writing about more of these tricks as I use the platform.</p>
