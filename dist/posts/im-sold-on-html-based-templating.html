        <p>I&#39;ve finally come around to liking HTML-based templates. I&#39;ve been a hold-out for a long time but I&#39;m finding it harder and harder to resist the tide and I&#39;m officially calling it today; HTML templates have won.</p>
<p>What am I talking about? If you&#39;ve done heavy JavaScript developer since, well the dawn of time, you&#39;re probably used to creating templates a lot like this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">script</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">type</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"text/mustache"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">template"</span>&gt;</span><span class="handlebars"><span class="xml">
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">span</span>&gt;</span>Hello<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">span</span>&gt;</span> </span><span class="hljs-expression">{{<span class="hljs-variable">name</span>}}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>This is a hack, always has been. The script tag was never intended to hold arbitrary strings for later processing, but it does, so it&#39;s always been a good fit for templates. Then Web Components came around (which I&#39;ve written about <a href="http://dailyjs.com/2014/03/10/components-controls/">here</a>) and introduced the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag. The template tag brought some major benefits; namely that the content is parsed but not executed. This means that a template can have <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags with JavaScript, CSS, etc. and none of it is ran until the template is inserted into the page.</p>
<p>This is great! This means you can define, for example, a custom element and it&#39;s template, then have some JavaScript to execute on insert. Then to activate a template all you have to do is use <code>document.importNode</code> and insert it anywhere you like and <em>boom</em>, it&#39;s like inserting new HTML into the page.</p>
<h2 id="how-things-changed">How Things Changed</h2>
<p>The problem with templates has always been that they do not define a data-binding strategy. And for obvious reasons they can&#39;t. Can you imagine Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Apple and others all agreeing on, for example, Mustache as the data-binding language for templates? No way! Never going to happen. And because of that we only get basic HTML. The problem is that basic HTML isn&#39;t all that great for dynamic creation. It&#39;s just XML, and XML just has tags and attributes. That doesn&#39;t have the power of a string-concatenation-based templating language like Mustache.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#39;t matter. Angular has shown that HTML-based templating can work. And devs have spoken; we like to put the HTML straight into the page. Adding script tags or importing HTML from a module-loader feels foreign and weird.</p>
<p>So the question becomes, will there be a standard developed around HTML-based templates? Probably not. But there are certainly a variety of patterns that are emerging, such as <code>for-each=&quot;items&quot;</code> to iterate a list. One of my colleagues <a href="https://twitter.com/daffl">David Luecke</a> released <a href="http://daffl.github.io/breezy/">HTML Breezy</a> recently, a Virtual-DOM backed HTML based templating engine that runs in both Node and the browser. So me, I&#39;m sold. My next templating language will be HTML. The <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag is too compelling to continue to ignore.</p>
