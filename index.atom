		<p>Hover.com redesigned their admin interface a while back, and I'd only gotten the chance to play around with it a little bit. One of the nice things about Hover has always been it's simplicity and lack of noise as compared to a site like Go Daddy. A couple of weeks back I was doing some maintenance on unused domains and decided to poke around, finally coming across the Forwards interface.</p>
		<p>To my surprise Hover.com has set up some forwards without my permission or knowledge. Luckily the domain in question is completely unused. If this had been my name domain I would be considerable more upset. But nevertheless, this is unacceptable. I don't want Hover profiting off of my domains except through charging me money for the services they provide.</p>
