	<p>Hover.com redesigned their admin interface a while back, and I'd only gotten the chance to play around with it a little bit. One of the nice things about Hover has always been it's simplicity and lack of noise as compared to a site like Go Daddy. A couple of weeks back I was doing some maintenance on unused domains and decided to poke around, finally coming across the Forwards interface.</p>
	<p>To my surprise Hover.com has set up some forwards without my permission or knowledge. Luckily the domain in question is completely unused. If this had been my name domain I would be considerable more upset. But nevertheless, this is unacceptable. I don't want Hover profiting off of my domains except through charging me money for the services they provide.</p>
	<p>Having little knowledge with how forwards work, I'm a little ignorant the extent of the damage here. Had I been serving a list of my favorite movies at mpliment.me/Movies, would traffic be rerouted to Imdb? My guess is they would.</p>
	<p>Overall I think Hover provides a solid product. Perhaps the little margin they get off domain sales isn't enough to cover costs and they are hoping they can get away with shady practices like this without people noticing. I noticed though, and I'll be moving all of my domains off Hover over the next couple of weeks. Finding a good domain/DNS provider is increasingly tough.</p>
	<p>For now I'll be moving my stuff over to Name.com, who seem to provide a solid service. It remains to be seen whether they'll do something similar; they have a solid reputation as far as I can tell. I've already moved my name domain there, which means I'm completely off Go Daddy for good. I have 8 or 9 domains with Hover including a couple that I absolutely don't want to get fucked up.</p>
