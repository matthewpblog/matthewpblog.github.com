	<p>The more I use the internet, the more I notice how jaw-droppingly difficult it is to find anything. Take this example: <a href="http://www.google.com/#q=javascript&hl=en&biw=1278&bih=921&fp=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&cad=b">JavaScript</a>.</p>
	<p>There's no real reason for the results to be this bad. You have a distinct name. You have something of immense popularity. Something of immense importance even; importance to Google itself.  But this is what they give us:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Download Free Java Software - The first link doesn't have anything to do with JavaScript at all. Insstead it takes you to download the runtime for Java. I could understand matching on partial names if there weren't any hits for the given name; but in this case? And the first result?</li>
