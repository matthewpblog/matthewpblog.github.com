	<p>The more I use the internet, the more I notice how jaw-droppingly difficult it is to find anything. Take this example: <a href="http://www.google.com/#q=javascript&hl=en&biw=1278&bih=921&fp=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&cad=b">JavaScript</a>.</p>
	<p>There's no real reason for the results to be this bad. You have a distinct name. You have something of immense popularity. Something of immense importance even; importance to Google itself.  But this is what they give us:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Download Free Java Software - The first link doesn't have anything to do with JavaScript at all. Instead it takes you to download the runtime for Java. I could understand matching on partial names if there weren't any hits for the given name; but in this case? And the first result?</li>
		<li>JavaScript - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - Can't complain too much about this one. For those who are just looking to learn what the heck js is, Wikipedia is as good of a place as any.</li>
		<li>How do I enable JavaScript in my browser? - I'm going to go ahead and guess that most of Google's users already have JavaScript enabled in their browsers. Google wouldn't be making the design choices they have been making recently if that wasn't the case. So why does this appear at all for a generic search? Your guess is as good as mine.</li>
		<li>JavaScript Source - Oh boy! Our first non-Wikipedia link that's actually about JavaScript. I wasn't familiar with JavaScript Source so I followed the link and poked around a bit. My first reaction is that there a lot of ads. Like a lot. I don't have a problem with ads, or with websites making money, but this one has so many that it's difficult to the ads from the content. But that might be because there is little content. Being ranked #4 on Google is probably good business for this site. They do have a decent amount of content in their forums, for what that's worth, and some code examples of suspect quality. Not looking good, Google.</li>
		<li>JQuery - Popular enough that a not-small segment of people think it's its own language. Nothing can probably match it in terms of popularity, and it's probably reasonable that a good portion of people searching for JavaScript really just want JQuery anyways.</li>
		<li>JavaScript.com - I'm sensing a pattern here. This domain is owned by the same people who have JavaScript Source, a company called internet.com, who seem to be in the SEO game, because they have a lot of good domains like JavaScript.com, internet.com, and developer.com. The content on this one is a bit lower than on JavaScript Source so I should give Google credit for at least getting those two listings in the right order; not that they should be on page 1 at all.</li>
		<li>JavaScript Kit - Not terrible, of all of the lower quality SEO type of sites, this one seems the best. It actually has some decent references, like <a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/json.shtml">this page</a> about the JSON object (I know, they mention eval).</li>
		<li>JavaScript: The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language - Crockford! He wrote the definitive JS book, JavaScript, The Good Parts, and his page is just as excellent. This is the type of resource that searchers should be presented with. It doesn't assume you're stupid, and includes some excellent guides, such as <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/private.html">this one</a> on private functions.</li>
		<li>JavaScript MDN - The Mozilla documentation is perhaps the best on the web. Unfortunately it's low enough that most won't every get this far.</li>
	</ol>
    <p>Overall I would rank these results as poor. There are 2 gems, Crockford's site and MDN, the rest are either off-topic or low SEO garbage quality stuff.  This brings me back to my earlier point; how the heck do we find anything on the internet? Some times I feel like there is a whole world of excellent content out there that I'm completely unaware of, because the custodians of the web are failing to surface is.</p>
