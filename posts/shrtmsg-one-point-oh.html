	<p>Having reached a relatively stable state, I'm ready to call <a href="http://shrtmsg.com">shrtmsg</a> a 1.0 product. It should be rolling out to your browsers soon.  If you're super anxious you can refresh your browser twice and you should see the new version. For those who have been using shrtmsg since the beginning you'll definitely notice a difference, and I hope it will be a welcome one. iPhone users with an icon on your homescreen, you'll want to remove it and readd with the newer one pictured to the left.</p>
	<p><a href="http://join.app.net">App.net</a> has progressed rapidly in the month / month-and-a-half since it was conceived from Dalton Caldwell's brain. My goal for shrtmsg is to progress along with it and to provide a mobile web experience that is at parity (or as close to parity as possible) with the native mobile apps. With that being said, here are some of the new features that you will see in this new release.</p>
	<h2>User Profiles</h2>
	<figure class="user-profile">

		</a>

	<p>The 1.0 release adds support for user profile pages where you can view information about a user, follow/unfollow them, mute/unmute them, and view their most recents posts. The header includes the user's cover image. This gives me a reason to finally add one to my profile.</p>
	<h2>Add a photo</h2>
	<figure class="hashtag">

	<p>shrtmsg now integrates with Imgur to give you a place to upload photos from your phone. In supporting browsers (iOS 6+, Android, Chrome, and Firefox Beta) just click on the camera icon and either pick an image from your gallery or take a new shot. More image hosting providers to come in future releases.</p>
	<h2>Hashtags</h2>
	<p>The conversation view is great for short exchanges between a few people.  When either the user or message count gets too high it can become unweildy. Hashtags are a great way to have a conversation with the entire App.net community without flooding users' mention stream. Now in shrtmsg, if you find a hashtag you like, you can view the stream of discussion as it happens. I often find myself sitting on a hashtag, refreshing every few minutes. As events happen this will become even more useful. I have more plans to extend shrtmsg's relationship with hashtags because I personally really love them!</p>
	<h2>Open Web Apps</h2>
	<p>I'm a big proponent of Mozilla's <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/apps/partners/">Open Web Apps</a> initiative. While still in early stages, Open Web Apps can be used in Firefox today.  For Android users, the best experience shrtmsg provides is through the installed web app. However, you'll need a pre-beta version.  I suggest <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox Nightly</a>. Once installed, navigate the browser <a href="http://shrtmsg.com/install.html">here</a> and click the install button. An icon for shrtmsg will be placed on your home screen which can be launched into a full-screen, chromeless application.</p>
