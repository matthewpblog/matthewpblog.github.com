	<p>Having reached a relatively stable state, I'm ready to call <a href="http://shrtmsg.com">shrtmsg</a> a 1.0 product. It should be rolling out to your browsers soon.  If you're super anxious you can refresh your browser twice and you should see the new version. For those who have been using shrtmsg since the beginning you'll definitely notice a difference, and I hope it will be a welcome one. <a href="http://join.app.net">App.net</a> has progressed rapidly in the month / month-and-a-half since it was conceived from Dalton Caldwell's brain. My goal for shrtmsg is to progress along with it and to provide a mobile web experience that is at parity (or as close to parity as possible) with the native mobile apps. Some developers try to hide the fact that their apps use the web (the so-called hybrid approach), but this is not my philosophy. With shrtmsg I want to embrace the web's core strengths. With that being said, here are some of the new features that you will see in this new release.</p>
	<h2>User Profiles</h2>
	<p>The 1.0 release adds support for user profile pages where you can view information about a user, follow/unfollow them, mute/unmute them, and view their most recents posts. The header includes the user's cover image. This gives me a reason to finally add one to my profile.</p>
