	<p>The word of the moment seems to be "ecosystem", coming off of the announcement of Amazon's Kindle Fire tablet. In their case ecosystem refers to the catalog of media content Amazon has built up: books, movies, tv shows, music, and apps. If you're talking about Google ecosystem means something else. It's their web services: email, calendar, maps, etc. If you're talking about Apple you're probably mostly referring to their dedicated developer community. And of course Microsoft has their ecosystem, RIM has theirs, even Samsung to some degree.</p>
	<p>Whichever type of ecosystem you're referring to, the hook is that each element of the ecosystem talks to the other elements. Getting back to the Kindle Fire, we have a device meant to primarily serve <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3057714">as a display</a> for Amazon's ecosystem content. They even go so far as to control <i>web browsing</i> on their device by routing all web traffic through an EC2 cache. Many have now declared this as the new era of personal computing: the era of ecosystems.</p>
	<p>Taking off the aluminum foil hat, this is precicely what I don't want. I don't want my social network account piping into my RSS reader (argh.. Google Reader!), I don't want to get my movies from the same place I host my open source projects.. Putting aside the vendor lock-in aspect of ecosystems, I simply don't trust monolithic ecosystems to put the care into their individual services. How many developers do these companies have their are dedicated to one and only one of their products?<p>
	<p>Perhaps I'm turning into a luddite, but I plan on shedding myself of all ecosystems. Even when doing so might be painful. I'm currently pretty heavily invested in the Google ecosystem but I'm going to be breaking up with Google (more on that in a later post). Not because of anything they've done. But because I do not trust myself to not get trapped in an ecosystem. Data mobility be damned; when you're invested it's hard to break that frame of thought.</p>
