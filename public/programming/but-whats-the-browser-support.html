  <h1>But what's the browser support?</h1>

<main>
<p>Too often when I get excited about some new browser API and I discuss it with colleagues I'm met with the dreaded question we've all heard: <em>"But what's the browser support?"</em></p>

<p>If you get excited about new APIs you've heard this too. What's most discouraging about this question is that as soon as you hear it you know there's only 1 acceptable answer in their head: <em>all browsers</em>.</p>

<p>Do you really want to build your app optimized for the worst browsers that a fraction of your customers will use? Do you want to tell the vast majority of your customers: You can't have this nice feature because 8 out of 100 people wouldn't be able to use it?</p>

<p>Graceful degradation allows you to adopt new APIs while providing an equivalent, if slightly less nice, experience to non-supporting browsers. Use it.</p>

<p>There are some APIs that are difficult to degrade, and in those cases more caution is justified. For the most part though, it's as simple as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">if(navigator.shinyNewFeature) {
  // Ooh yeah! üí™
} else {
  // Plain experience here
}</code></pre>

<p>So the next time someone kills your buzz about a new web API, remind them that you aim higher than a lowest common denominator experience in your apps.</p>
