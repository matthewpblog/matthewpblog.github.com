  <h1>Styling a fullscreen PWA</h1>
</header>

<main>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/">Web App Manifest</a> is the format that defines metadata about an application, so that a user can add it to their homescreen.</p>

<p>One of the important properties in this file is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#display-modes">display mode</a>. For most types of applications, in order to behave like a native app, you would choose <strong>standalone</strong>. However, for some other types of applications where you would want the OS status bars to be hidden, you can select <strong>fullscreen</strong>. An example here would be a game.</p>

<p>Now, let's say your game includes a button that toggles fullscreen mode when in a normal webpage. The <a href="https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/">Fullscreen API</a> allows for this by calling <code>element.requestFullscreen()</code> to go into fullscreen mode and <code>document.exitFullscreen()</code> to exit.</p>

<p>When the app is running as a fullscreen PWA there is no need for this toggle button, and in fact it won't work. You can't exit fullscreen when in this display mode. So best thing to do is to hide it.</p>

<p>The fullscreen API includes a <a href="https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#:fullscreen-pseudo-class">:fullscreen pseudo-class</a>. It can be used to target elements that are in fullscreen. However, this won't do what you want:</p>

<pre class="language-css"><code>.root:fullscreen #fullscreen-button {
  display: none;
}</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is that when the app is running in a normal browser window we <em>don't</em> want to hide the button when in fullscreen mode. So how can we target when the app is running in the fullscreen display mode, per the manifest file?</p>

<p>The spec authors were clever enough to think of this and gave us the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#the-display-mode-media-feature">display-mode media query</a>. It allows targeting specifically when in fullscreen display mode, per running as a PWA. You use it like this:</p>

<pre class="language-css"><code>@media all and (display-mode: fullscreen) {
    
}</code></pre>

<p>However, this is <strong>not</strong> the answer to our dilemma:</p>

<pre class="language-css"><code>@media all and (display-mode: fullscreen) {
  .root #fullscreen-button {
    display: none;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>The problem with the above is that on some OSes (Android at least), the window <em>is</em> in fullscreen display mode whenever you enter fullscreen; whether that be full the manifest file or from using <code>element.requestFullscreen()</code> in a browser window. Since we want to display the button when you get to fullscreen from a browser window, we can't use this approach.</p>

<p>The trick is, when running as a PWA, the display-mode will be fullscreen but the <code>:fullscreen</code> pseudo-class will not match. I'm not entirely clear on why this is, but I'm assuming it is because that class only matches when the JavaScript API is used to enter fullscreen.</p>

<p>With all of that being said, here is our final solution:</p>

<pre class="language-css"><code>@media all and (display-mode: fullscreen) {
  .root:not(:fullscreen) #fullscreen-button {
    display: none;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>This says to match when the <code>.root</code> not does <strong>not</strong> match the fullscreen selector, but is in fullscreen display-mode. And that's it!</p>
