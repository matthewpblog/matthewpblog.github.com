    <main>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>For the past several years I have been using <a href="http://www.cabinjs.com/">Cabin</a> for my personal blog. Cabin works like most other static site generators in the vein of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>; you write your posts in markdown in a posts folder, your templates in a template folder, run a script and it generates the HTML for your blog. Simple enough.</p>

<p>The problem I've always had with this setup is that it has just enough friction that I wind up not blogging as often as I would like. During your &quot;draft&quot; stage you still have most of the same steps as when you finally deploy. You have to clone your site, create a branch to write a new post in, write, commit and push. When I have inspiration to write I want to just write, not manage a project.</p>

<p>So what I usually do is write my posts in Gist or Google Docs and then move them to my site project when I'm done. I started thinking, what if I could remove the blog engine entirely?</p>

<p>My first thought was to set up a server that just served Gists directly. To this end I set up an <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> server that did exactly that.  I had a Gist that I <a href="https://gist.github.com/matthewp/695b163d39f68ec73678">used as my index</a> of all Gists I wanted to be served. The front page was just a list of links to each article with the url containing the Gist id.</p>

<p>To make this work with my existing posts I needed to convert them to gists. This was more work than I expected. Cabin uses a non-standard front-matter format. Most blog engines use YAML but Cabin uses a JavaScript-like syntax.  I would have expected it to be JSON but it's not, the keys are not strings. To figure out how they did this I had to dig through their source and found it <a href="https://github.com/CabinJS/grunt-pages/blob/4cd264fce21fb8d90198edadeccb3961b37537bc/tasks/pages.js#L269">buried in a Grunt task</a>. It was easy enough to extract this code and reuse it for my needs. Each gist contains the markdown content (minus the front-matter) and a <code>metadata.json</code> file containing the front-matter (now json).</p>

<p>This all worked well enough but I felt uneasy about pulling directly from Gist to serve the blog posts. It just felt wasteful, even if I included caching that prevented it from fetching the gists on each requests. Additional it broke my old links. I played around with the idea of having a &quot;slug&quot; that would serve as the id for a post, but this meant I would need to pull that index gist to find out which gist id the slug referred to. Again, not terrible, just more code than I wanted.</p>

<h2>One thing well</h2>

<p>I've always been a fan of the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well, so I started to think why not construct the posts using basic cli tools already available. You can easily pull down a gist using the GitHub API and then use a series of other tools to generate the html. The full bash script can be seen below, but here's the pseudo-code of what happens:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">curl https://api.github.com/gists/$GIST_ID | \
jq '.files[.files | keys[0]].content' | \
marked | hb -i post.handlebars
</code></pre>

<p>It's pretty simple, let me explain what easy step does:</p>

<h3>curl api.github.com</h3>

<p>Luckily pulling down gists is really easy with the GitHub API. Unless you are doing it a lot, and likely programmatically, you don't even need to set up an auth token, but you can do this if you want. It returns a JSON containing a lot of data, but we really just want the post content.</p>

<h3>jq</h3>

<p><a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> is an amazing command-line JSON parser. In its simplest form jq can be used as a prettifier, but you can do advanced stuff to extract just the parts that you need.</p>

<p>Its power is shown here because the gist JSON structure makes it slightly difficult to extract the post content. This is because instead of having an array of <code>files</code> it has an object where the file name is the key. This is fine for when you know the name of a file, but in my case I just wanted to assume that the first file in a gist is the markdown.</p>

<p>Lucky jq can easily handle this. Consider the structure is like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;files&quot;: {
    &quot;foo.md&quot;: {
      &quot;something&quot;: &quot;else&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Title\nsome test\n* a list&quot;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With jq you can run <code>jq '.files[.files | keys[0]].content'</code>. This gets <code>.files</code> and then uses the <code>keys</code> function to get all of the keys of the files object and uses the key indexed 0 to get the &quot;foo.md&quot; object and finally we want <code>.content</code> which is the markdown.</p>

<h3>marked</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked">marked</a> is the premier markdown compiler (to html) for JavaScript. Luckily it include a command-line tool that takes markdown from stdin and spits out html to stdout. Perfect.</p>

<p>One downside is that it doesn't include a way to highlight code. If using the Node.js API you can set options which includes using a highlighter of your choice. I usually use <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">hightlight.js</a>. With that the code would be something like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">var marked = require(&quot;marked&quot;);

marked.setOptions({
  highlight: function(){
    return require(&quot;highlight.js&quot;).highlightAuto(code).value;
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This is an <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked/issues/110">open issue</a> about how this could be used with the cli. My suggestion was to provide a module that exports options. This way you could write the above code as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">var marked = require(&quot;marked&quot;);

module.exports = {
  highlight: function(){
    return require(&quot;highlight.js&quot;).highlightAuto(code).value;
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>And feed that option into the <code>marked</code> cli.  It becomes:</p>

<pre><code>cat my-post.md | marked --options /path/to/options.js
</code></pre>

<p>They <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked/pull/613">haven't yet accepted</a> this change but I do have it working in my own fork.</p>

<h3>hb</h3>

<p>Having gone from gist into json into markdown into html, the final step is to run the produced html through a template engine so that the article is contained within a full page. Since I'm already very familiar with the Mustache syntax in my day job I decided to use <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a> for templates. A simple post template can be:</p>

<pre><code class="language-handlebars">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;{{title}} | My Blog&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link href=&quot;some.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;article&gt;
    {{{content}}}
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We just need to feed the generated html through this template to generate a post. I couldn't find a project that did exactly what I need; take json and a template and produce html, so I forked a close-enough project and adjusted it, creating <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars-render">handlebars-render</a> which does this.  You can use it like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">echo '{&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;}' | hb -i page.handlebars
</code></pre>

<p>The output of <strong>marked</strong> is fed into this script. I use a <code>metadata.json</code> file in my gist that provices the post date, title, and tags (which I don't currently support, but could in the future).  Usage winds up like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">DATA=&quot;{\&quot;id\&quot;: $ID, \&quot;title\&quot;: $TITLE, \&quot;content\&quot;: $HTML, \&quot;metadata\&quot;: $METADATA, \&quot;date\&quot;: $DATE}&quot;
echo $DATA | hb -i templates/post.handlebars
</code></pre>

<p>There's probably a better way to create a json string (perhaps with jq) but this works well enough for my needs.</p>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

<p>And that's it! With those core scripts I can easily put everything together that generates html. My script is simple:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">#!/bin/bash
GIST_ID=$1

IFS='%'

GIST_JSON=`curl -H &quot;Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN&quot; -s https://api.github.com/gists/$GIST_ID`

CONTENT=`echo $GIST_JSON | jq '.files[.files | keys[0]].content'`
METADATA=`echo $GIST_JSON | jq -r '.files[&quot;metadata.json&quot;].content'`
HTML=`echo $CONTENT | jq -r '.' | marked --options marked_options.js | jq -s -R '.'`

# Get the title either from metadata.title or .description
TITLE=`[[ &quot;$METADATA&quot; == &quot;null&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; echo $GIST_JSON | jq '.description' || echo $METADATA | jq '.title'`
ID=`echo $GIST_JSON | jq &quot;.id&quot;`
DATE=\&quot;`[[ &quot;$METADATA&quot; == &quot;null&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;foo&quot; || echo $METADATA | jq -r '.date' | xargs -I{} gdate -d {} +%Y-%m-%d`\&quot;

DATA=&quot;{\&quot;id\&quot;: $ID, \&quot;title\&quot;: $TITLE, \&quot;content\&quot;: $HTML, \&quot;metadata\&quot;: $METADATA, \&quot;date\&quot;: $DATE}&quot;

echo $DATA | hb -i templates/post.handlebars
</code></pre>

<p>There's some backwards compatible stuff happening in the script or it would be even shorter; but even as it stands I'll take a fairly easy to read 20 LOC script as the basis for my blog any day. All that is needed is a environment variable <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and a gist id provided as the first parameter and the script will spit out html.</p>

<p>I've got other scripts that do things like generate the index.html page and a script that will generate all posts (I keep a <code>posts</code> file that just lists the gist id and slug for these purposes).</p>

<p>I'm relatively happy that I've been able to create an extremely light weight &quot;static site generate&quot; that's just scripted small utilities.</p>
