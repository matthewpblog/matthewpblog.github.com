      <h1>How hot module swapping works</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p><a href="http://stealjs.com/">Steal</a> added hot module swapping (aka live reload, aka hot module replacement) about 6 months ago, but how it works isn't obvious, so I thought I'd write about it. You can read more about the feature and how to use it <a href="http://blog.bitovi.com/hot-module-replacement-comes-to-stealjs/">here</a>.  This article is more technical and explains what happens under the hood. Don't worry, there's nothing overly complex here and it's rather easy to understand once you understand dependency graphs.</p>

<h2>Dependency graph</h2>

<p>When you load your app using Steal (or any other module loader) it saves the modules in a registry.  A registry is just an object where the keys are the module names (like <strong>lodash</strong>) and the values are the module values (like a function or an object; whatever it is you export from the module).</p>

<p>With Steal we retain another data structure that lists modules (by their module name) and metadata about them, specifically what their dependencies are. We call this the <strong>dependency graph</strong>.  It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">{
  &quot;lodash&quot;: {
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: []
  },
  &quot;jquery&quot;: {
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: []
  },
  &quot;my/custom/element&quot;: {
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: [&quot;jquery&quot;, &quot;lodash&quot;]
  },
  &quot;my/main/app&quot;: {
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: [&quot;jquery&quot;, &quot;my/custom/element&quot;]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's pretty simple.  Each key is a module name and the value is an object that contains metadata; most importantly is an array of the module's dependencies.</p>

<h2>File watcher</h2>

<p>To know when a module changes we need a server that watches for file changes. This is what happens when you run <code>steal-tools live-reload</code>.</p>

<p>The live-reload server gets the dependency graph of your project and listens for file changes to each module. The dependency graph shown above also has a property called <strong>address</strong> that is the path to the module's file. We add a file watcher to every file in the graph so that we know when work has been saved.</p>

<p>When you open a page in your app with the live-reload server running it establishes a connection to that server with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSocket</a>. By default it uses port 8012.</p>

<p>The file watcher will see changes to the files in the dependency graph and send a message through the WebSocket back to the browser with the name of the module that changed.</p>

<h2>Tearing down the graph</h2>

<p>Back on the browser side, it receives the WebSocket message with the name of the module that changed. Since the module changed we need to re-import it. But we also need to re-import it's parent modules (the modules that import it) and the parent's then need to import their parents, etc. all the way up the graph.</p>

<p>This might sound wrong to you; why do you need to re-import the parent modules?  Consider this example:</p>

<h3>Module A</h3>

<pre><code class="language-js">module.exports = function(){
  return &quot;foo&quot;;
};
</code></pre>

<h3>Module B</h3>

<pre><code class="language-js">var moduleA = require(&quot;module-a&quot;);

moduleA(); // -&gt; &quot;foo&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>And then consider that module A changes to this:</p>

<h3>Module A</h3>

<pre><code class="language-js">module.exports = function(){
  return &quot;bar&quot;;
};
</code></pre>

<p>If we don't re-import Module B then it will continue to have a reference to the old Module A function that returns &quot;foo&quot;. In JavaScript once you have a reference to an object or a function that reference can never be changed by external code.</p>

<p>So to solve this we simply walk up the dependency graph and get a list of modules that need to be reloaded. Consider the original example graph:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">{
  &quot;lodash&quot;: {
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: []
  },
  &quot;jquery&quot;: {
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: []
  },
  &quot;my/util&quot;: {
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: []
  },
  &quot;my/custom/element&quot;: {
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: [&quot;jquery&quot;, &quot;lodash&quot;, &quot;my/util&quot;]
  },
  &quot;my/main/app&quot;: {
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: [&quot;jquery&quot;, &quot;my/custom/element&quot;]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's say my/util changes. Its only has one parent (the modules that depend on it), my/custom/element. However my/main/app depends on my/custom/element so we have to reload that as well. We tear down the graph by removing these modules from the registry. Afterwards the graph looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">{
  &quot;lodash&quot;: {
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: []
  },
  &quot;jquery&quot;: {
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: []
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just lodash and jquery remain. We reimport the top-level parent module after walking all the way up the graph, in our case it is my/main/app. By reimporting the top-level parent it will reimport the modules that have been deleted from the registry, here it is my/custom/element and my/util. However any other dependencies, such as jquery and lodash, are not reimported because they are already in the registry.</p>

<p>Steal contains several optimizations that makes the reloading blazing fast. For most changes you'll see your changes reflected in under 100ms.</p>

<p>The basic operation of what Steal does to reload modules is quite simple. The hard work comes from plugins and code that use the live-reload APIs. In the future I'd like to write a bit more on what these plugins do and how <em>they</em> work as well.</p>
