      <h1>Markdown Enable Your Blog Comments with Web Components</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>If you're like me and are excited about getting started using web components today, you might find yourself struggling coming up with practical uses that aren't the typical carousel, calendar, or <a href="http://matthewphillips.info/posts/building-an-accordion-with-can-component.html">accordion</a> widgets that we've all written a hundred times in plain JavaScript.</p>

<p>In this article I'll walk you through the process of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Finding a practical use for web components.</p></li>

<li><p>Developing your first iteration.</p></li>

<li><p>Refining, deciding when components are needed and when they are just extra fluff.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All of my examples will use <a href="http://canjs.com/guides/Components.html">can.Component</a> because it's available today, is stable, and has really good browser support, but are still applicable no matter what your web component framework of choice is.</p>

<h1>From Concept to Code</h1>

<p>If all you're interested in is learning you can pick just about any API on the web and turn it into a web component. Or pick your favorite JavaScript library and wrap a component around it. Web components are primed to be the new jQuery plugin.</p>

<h2>Markdown</h2>

<p>If you're a programmer you probably use markdown (or another markup generator) quite often. I'm writing this post in markdown right now. The only downside is I have a Grunt task running in the background that is rerendering the html every time I save the file. What if you could write markdown and have it generate all in the browser? You want to write something like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;markdown&gt;
# Hello world!

* Oh my, **lists**
&lt;/markdown&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And let a library do the heavy lifting. Luckily there is a <a href="https://github.com/coreyti/showdown">Showdown</a>, a JavaScript library for turning markdown into HTML. It's pretty fantastic. So let's make a component.</p>

<p>Since Showdown does most of the heavy lifting all we need is a nice wrapper that will allow us to write Markdown inside of a tag and have it render the HTML automatically. Using can.Component we can do that easily, here's a demo:</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/TBFp6/3/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>The code should speak for itself. The <code>x-markdown</code> component (all web components should be namespaced, we use <code>x-</code> in this example) generates the HTML after it is inserted into the page. We simply listen for the <code>inserted</code> event and set the <code>&lt;content/&gt;</code> provided by the user to the <code>markdown</code> property on the component's Scope.</p>

<p>The powerful part of this example is the <code>can.compute</code>. Computes are a type of object that can listen to changes of other objects and automatically recompute themselves. If you've used <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html">ko.observable</a> or Ember <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/computed-properties/">computed properties</a> the idea is much the same, but can.computes are a bit more powerful (we'll get to that later).</p>

<p>The compute simple takes the value of the <code>markdown</code> property (which is set in the <code>inserted</code> event) and uses Showdown to generate the html that will be displayed.</p>

<h1>Using with Blog Comments</h1>

<p>While cool, this example isn't that practical. In reality you'll rarely have a scenario where you need to write HTML inside of a web browser, otherwise using a static site generator is probably what you'll be using.</p>

<p>One place where you would want to generate the HTML on the fly is for blog comments. If your blog is developer-focused it makes sense to allow the reader to write comments in markdown, and have a live preview of what it will look like. So let's refactor <code>&lt;x-markdown&gt;</code> to be our live preview.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">can.Component.extend({
  tag: 'x-markdown',
  template: '&lt;div&gt;{{{html}}}&lt;/div&gt;',
  scope: {
    html: can.compute(function() {
      var markdown = this.attr('markdown');
      var converter = new Showdown.converter();
      var html = converter.makeHtml(markdown);
      return html;
    }),
    markdown: ''
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This new version of <code>&lt;x-markdown&gt;</code> is much more succinct because we've eliminated the <code>&lt;content/&gt;</code> portion by getting the raw markdown from a textarea. can.Component allows you to pass data (included complex objects) through an element's attribute tags. We'll use it like such: <code>&lt;x-markdown markdown=&quot;value&quot;&gt;&lt;/x-markdown&gt;</code> so that the <code>html</code> compute will be live-bound to the <code>value</code> object that we pass in.</p>

<p>Next we need to create a live-bound textarea we'll call <code>&lt;x-textarea&gt;</code>. The idea that both x-markdown and x-textarea will be live-bound to the same compute object, and any time you type into the textarea the markdown will automatically be rerendered in the preview window. Demo time:</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/TBFp6/6/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Try out the fiddle (Click on the <strong>Result</strong> link) and see for yourself how the preview updates as you type. The secret sauce here is that we are using <code>can-value</code> to bind the textarea's <code>value</code> to our scope property also called <code>value</code>. can-value works on the element's <code>change</code> event, which for most types of forms is fine, but in our case we need the preview to update as you type, so we've added a <code>keyup</code> event that simply triggers the textarea's change event as the user types. Simple!</p>

<h1>When not to Web Component</h1>

<p>Awesome, we've built a live-bound markdown enabled comment system. In less than 30 lines of code. However you might notice that the <code>&lt;x-textarea&gt;</code> isn't really doing much at all. It simply turns a normal textarea into a live-bound one.</p>

<p>However in reality textareas <em>really are</em> live-bound, they use the normal DOM events to update their values. So all we are using the <code>&lt;x-textarea&gt;</code> for in practice is to turn the DOM events into can events. Luckily <a href="http://canjs.com/docs/can.compute.html">can.compute</a> already has a way of doing this, so we don't need the <code>x-textarea</code> at all.</p>

<p>can.compute can take a set of arguments that includes an element, the property to bind to, and an event to bind to. We'll use it like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var markdown = can.compute(textarea, 'value', 'keyup');
</code></pre>

<p>This allows us to move our textarea outside of the script tag (since we're getting rid of the component) but still have a live-bound value between the textarea and our <code>x-markdown</code> preview. See the demo below.</p>

<p>Hopefully I've demonstrated the process of coming up with an idea for a component (essentially an encapsulated piece of HTML with JavaScript interactivity) and refining it until you are left with only the bits of code that you need. We've created a Markdown-enabled blog commenting system is only 18 lines of code. Let it be inspiration for your next component. Can you do better, how about an MDN reference widget?</p>
