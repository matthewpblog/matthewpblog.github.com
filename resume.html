								<h3>Lead Developer</h3>

									<li>Utilized reflexive design principles to achieve an interface that scaled from large desktops down to smartphones. Used Skeleton as the CSS framework, which gave us a 16 column grid system based on the 960 grid system.</li>
									<li>Used several HTML5 technologies on the project, including LocalStorage, Cache Manifest, CSS Transforms and Transitions and CORS.</li>
									<li>Consistently beat deadlines to ensure that the project will be delivered by the go-live date.</li>

									<li>Maintained their reporting web application, adding features as requested (http://www.revreports.com).</li>

In the newly designed process a batch of that size takes about five minutes.</li>
